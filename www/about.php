                    <p class="description">The Purdue Online Dining Guide offers a system that moniters the number of people in the dining courts. The website is provided for both students and staff to access such information. The purpose of this project is to help students go to dinner at more uniformly spaced intervals, creating shorter lines and less demand on the dining courts during "rush hour".</p>
